## üìÑ Introduction

AWS Cognito is one of the most widely used Identity Provider. There are scenarios where a customer who uses AWS Cognito wants to support social login with Google, Facebook, Twitter or other Identity providers. In this way, a user doesn‚Äôt have to create a new profile to access that particular service or app. For ex: As an organization, I can build a product which is integrated with AWS Cognito using OIDC. If I want my users to easily access my app using their gmail credentials, I can setup a federation between Cognito and Google using OIDC.


## üìê Architecture Design

## ‚û°Ô∏è Step 1 - Create a basic user pool


An Amazon Cognito user pool is a user directory for web and mobile app authentication and authorization. From the perspective of your app, an Amazon Cognito user pool is an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider (IdP). A user pool adds layers of additional features for security, identity federation, app integration, and customization of the user experience.

To create a basic user pool:

1. Navigate to the conlose, search for Amazon Cognito, click "Create user pool"

5. Desable "Self-registration" and "Cognito-assisted verification and confirmation, we don't need these optoins for this particular tutorial.

6. For required attributes select `email`, `family_name`, `given_name`, `name`
